## Expense Tracker

### Description
This application, built with the MERN stack, allows users to add and manage expenses and incomes, view their transaction history on a dashboard, and visualize data through charts. Currently, I am implementing authentication features and exploring additional ways to enhance transaction visualization and organization.

### How to set up:
- First clone the repo, navigate to project directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shilpa-bo/expense-tracker.git
cd expense-tracker
```
- Navigate to front end directory, install dependencies, start frontend application
```bash
cd frontend
npm install # Installs all dependencies listed in package.json
npm start
```
- Now do the same for the backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install # Installs all dependencies listed in package.json
nodemon app.js
```
